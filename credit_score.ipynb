    "# Introduction\n",
    "For our project, we are analyzing the Credit Score dataset from Kaggle, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using features that relate to bank details and credit-related information for a customer to classify their credit score into a credit score bracket, either Good, Bad, or Standard. In this project, we aim to tackle the machine learning problem of credit score classfiication. This problem is important for various financial instiutions, like banks, and other lending practices that tend to use credit scores. A credit score essentially represents an individual's creditworthiness, indicating the likelihood of them repaying borrowed money on time based on information from your credit reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is relevant as it impacts various aspects of financial-decision making. Many financial institutions heavily rely on credit scores to assess the risk associated with lending money to different individuals. In general, a higher credit score typically suggests a lower risk of default (considered Good), whereas a low credit score illustrates a higher risk. Therefore, accurate classification of credit scores into bins of Good, Bad, or Standard is crucial for lenders to make informed decisions about loan approvals and interest rates. Places like banks need to know if someone is likley to pay them back before they give out loans or credit cards, so they can give out loans more safely and avoid losing money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model that classifies a predict's if a person has a good, bad, or standard credit score can be utilized for several purposes. For loan approval, lenders can use the model to automate the process of loan approvals as they can use the prediction as an indicator of whether this person should receive a loan or not, which can streamline the operations and reduces manual workload. Similarly, other financial institutions can better assess the risk associated with lending to individuals, leading to more accurate loan prices and mitigate potential money losses. Furthermore, the model can assist in determining appropriate interest rates for loans based on the creditworthiness of applicants. Overall, with this machine learning model, the process of making decisions based on someone's credit related information can be automated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting credit score does matter because knowing someone's credit score helps banks understand how risky it is to lend them money, and if they can predict it accurately, they can offer fair interest rates and help more peolpe access loans and credit cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset includes a vast amount of a person's basic bank details and credit-related information. The dataset is setup in a way where multiple records are attached to the same customer. Essentially, each customer has 8 records associated with them: one record is associated with the customer's credit information for a particular month and every customer has records for January - August (8 months). Because the dataset is structured this way, it highlights how a person's credit score can change from, for instance, from Good to Standard, in a month if there is a change to the customer's information (open up more bank accounts one month, lose their job which means no income, forget to pay a statement).\n",
    "\n",

Many features like age, annual income, and number of bank accounts do not change that frequently month-to-month for a customer. Therefore, whenver we saw a customer with records that had age 23 for all 7 months and -500 for 1 month, which doesn't make sense at all, we replaced this outlier with the mode of the group (the 8 records for the particular customer). However, sometimes the mode doesn't exist, so in that case, we default to the mean. However, even the whole customer can be an outlier, rather than just 1 record. We noticed this when we saw that the mode value for a certain feature was out of the bounds of what we considered not an outlier. In this case, we dropped entire customer. To drop the entire customer, this helper function simply sets it to NaN, which gets dropped when we call .dropna later. This is a general explanation of what this helper function is supposed to do, and why we are cleaning the data in the way that we are."

We group the data by customer ID, which ensures that each customer is grouped together with all their records. The feature will then be cleaned, using the helper function I described above.

    "Occupation is a categorical variable that takes in values of different jobs like \"Lawyer\", \"Teacher\", \"Engineer\", etc. We want to be able to use this feature in our machine learning model, and there are some models that require numbers for inputs. Therefore, we can one hot encode this feature to represent a categorical variable as a numerical value within the dataset. Some records have no occupation in which we set the title to Unemployed."

    "Now that all the features have been thoroughly cleaned, we wanted to make sure that all the data types were good before continuing on. Next, we stored our labels in a variable, so that it is easily accessed later on as we will drop the column to preform steps for modeling. Customer_ID finally gets dropped as a feature because it is another feature that does not help tell us whether a customer has a good, bad, or standard credit score. Whenever, we one hot encode, having all columns can redundant because if we drop one of the columns for a one hot encoding of a feature, we know that the record belongs to the column if all other values for the feature is false. Once we check this, we are now ready to proceed to model and analyze machine learning results."

    "We trained 7 various models on our dataset to make predictions about whether a person’s credit score is good, standard or poor: decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, neural network, random forest, Adaboost, K-Means, and DBScan. \n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the efficacy of each model, we utilize several evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the predictions, which means that out all predictions made, how many were true. Precision quantifies the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. In other words, out of all the positive predictions, how many were true positive. Recall calculates the proportion of true positives that were correctly identified out of all data points that should be predicted as true. Lastly, F1-score provides a balanced measure of a model's performance, considering both precision and recall. It’s important to look at all these metrics instead of just accuracy as accuracy can be invalid and skewed at times. We want to attempt to maximize all these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initially trained models on the whole dataset, which was not a good idea for two reasons. The biggest reason is the idea of a class imbalance within the data. When exploring our dataset, we outputted the number of records with Standard, Good, and Poor. We quickly found that the Poor records weren't represented as much in the dataset. Therefore, we adjusted this class imbalance by downsampling our data and making each class have around 14000 records, which is the amount of data records with the label Poor. After downsampling, each class had the same number of records. The next reason why we wanted to downsample our data to train on was due to the running time fo the computationally expensive algorithms. Whenever we tried to train our models with our entire dataset with about 100000 records, the many of the algorithms, like the neural network, was not able to finish in a reasonable amount of time (did not finish after 3 hours of training).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now compare the results of the various machine learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Decision Tree\n",
    "- The overall accuracy of the decision tree model is around **73%**.\n",
    "- The results of the model shows decent accuracy with relatively balanced precision, recall, and F1-score for all three classes. Notably, the recall for the \"Standard\" class is slightly lower compared to the other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "- The overal accuracy of the trained KNN model is around **66%**.\n",
    "- This demonstrates a moderately well performance by the KNN model. However, the precision and recall was lower for the \"Standard\" class compared to the other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Neural Network\n",
    "- The overall accuracy of the trained Neural Network is around **72%**.\n",
    "- This model gave us a decently high precision, recall, and F1 score for all three class. However, similar to the previous two models, the precision and recall for the \"Standard\" class was relatively lower compared to \"Good\" and \"Poor\"\n",

    "### 4. Random Forest\n",
    "- The overall accuracy of the trained Random Forest model is around **72%**.\n",
    "- The results for this model was interesting because it predicted the exact same way as what the Neural Network did. The confusion matrix is identical for both of the models, giving us the same precision, recall, and F score throughout all classes. Therefore, similar to the Neural Network, the precision and recall for the \"Standard\" class was relatively lower compared to the other two classes.\n",

    "### 5. AdaBoost\n",
    "- The overall accuracy of the trained AdaBoost model was around **71%**.\n",
    "- Like the previous models, this model also performed pretty well, with a decently high accuracy. This model also slightly struggled in correctly classifying the \"Standard\" class in comparison to the other two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. K-Means\n",
    "- The overall accuracy of the trained K-Means model was around **25%**.\n",
    "- This had a really poor performance and demonstrates how it was worse than simply just guessing between Standard, Poor, and Good. The F Score for predicting the Standard class was a lot higher than the F score for the other two classes, which were extremely low.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. DBScan\n",
    "- The overall accuracy of the trained DBScan model was around **18%**.\n",
    "- This was the worst model that was trained, which simply demonstrates that this dataset is not fit to utilize DBScan as a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, after analyzing all the models that we trained, it is clear that the supervised learning models (Decision Tree, KNN, Neural Network, Random Forest, and AdaBoost) significantly outperform the unsupervised learning models (K-Means and DBScan). This suggestst that the task of classifying credit scores into Good, Poor, or Standard based on credit and banking information benefits greatly from labeled data. Decision Tree, Neural Network, Random Forest, and AdaBoost have similar performances, with accuracies ranging around 70-73%. KNN slightly lags behind, while unsupervised learning methods (K-Means and DBScan) perform poorly. Since the unsupervised learning models had similar performances, it's crucial to also think about how efficient each algorithm is for the data that we have (large number of records and high dimensionality), which can also help us decide which model to use for this dataset. Extra experimentation with ensemble methods or alternative, more complex machine learning algorithms could enhance the model accuracy. Furthermore, continued feature engineering can also yield improved performance. \n",
