    "# Introduction\n",
    "For our project, we are analyzing the Credit Score dataset from Kaggle, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using features that relate to bank details and credit-related information for a customer to classify their credit score into a credit score bracket, either Good, Bad, or Standard. In this project, we aim to tackle the machine learning problem of credit score classfiication. This problem is important for various financial instiutions, like banks, and other lending practices that tend to use credit scores. A credit score essentially represents an individual's creditworthiness, indicating the likelihood of them repaying borrowed money on time based on information from your credit reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is relevant as it impacts various aspects of financial-decision making. Many financial institutions heavily rely on credit scores to assess the risk associated with lending money to different individuals. In general, a higher credit score typically suggests a lower risk of default (considered Good), whereas a low credit score illustrates a higher risk. Therefore, accurate classification of credit scores into bins of Good, Bad, or Standard is crucial for lenders to make informed decisions about loan approvals and interest rates. Places like banks need to know if someone is likley to pay them back before they give out loans or credit cards, so they can give out loans more safely and avoid losing money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model that classifies a predict's if a person has a good, bad, or standard credit score can be utilized for several purposes. For loan approval, lenders can use the model to automate the process of loan approvals as they can use the prediction as an indicator of whether this person should receive a loan or not, which can streamline the operations and reduces manual workload. Similarly, other financial institutions can better assess the risk associated with lending to individuals, leading to more accurate loan prices and mitigate potential money losses. Furthermore, the model can assist in determining appropriate interest rates for loans based on the creditworthiness of applicants. Overall, with this machine learning model, the process of making decisions based on someone's credit related information can be automated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting credit score does matter because knowing someone's credit score helps banks understand how risky it is to lend them money, and if they can predict it accurately, they can offer fair interest rates and help more peolpe access loans and credit cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset includes a vast amount of a person's basic bank details and credit-related information. The dataset is setup in a way where multiple records are attached to the same customer. Essentially, each customer has 8 records associated with them: one record is associated with the customer's credit information for a particular month and every customer has records for January - August (8 months). Because the dataset is structured this way, it highlights how a person's credit score can change from, for instance, from Good to Standard, in a month if there is a change to the customer's information (open up more bank accounts one month, lose their job which means no income, forget to pay a statement).\n",
    "\n",

Many features like age, annual income, and number of bank accounts do not change that frequently month-to-month for a customer. Therefore, whenver we saw a customer with records that had age 23 for all 7 months and -500 for 1 month, which doesn't make sense at all, we replaced this outlier with the mode of the group (the 8 records for the particular customer). However, sometimes the mode doesn't exist, so in that case, we default to the mean. However, even the whole customer can be an outlier, rather than just 1 record. We noticed this when we saw that the mode value for a certain feature was out of the bounds of what we considered not an outlier. In this case, we dropped entire customer. To drop the entire customer, this helper function simply sets it to NaN, which gets dropped when we call .dropna later. This is a general explanation of what this helper function is supposed to do, and why we are cleaning the data in the way that we are."

We group the data by customer ID, which ensures that each customer is grouped together with all their records. The feature will then be cleaned, using the helper function I described above.

    "Now that all the features have been thoroughly cleaned, we wanted to make sure that all the data types were good before continuing on. Next, we stored our labels in a variable, so that it is easily accessed later on as we will drop the column to preform steps for modeling. Customer_ID finally gets dropped as a feature because it is another feature that does not help tell us whether a customer has a good, bad, or standard credit score. Whenever, we one hot encode, having all columns can redundant because if we drop one of the columns for a one hot encoding of a feature, we know that the record belongs to the column if all other values for the feature is false. Once we check this, we are now ready to proceed to model and analyze machine learning results."
